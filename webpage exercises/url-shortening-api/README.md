# URL shortening API landing page

Challenge was to build out landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Design was given as jpg images for mobile and desktop along with some starter html code and pictures. 

Of the required functionalities I have so far implemented: 
* Shorten any valid URL using https://rel.ink/ API
* See a list shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
* Copy the shortened link to clipboard in a single click
* Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if the `input` field is empty
* Desing for mobile (looks pretty much as the given mobile design)

Still to-do:
* responsive desing (desktop)
* "clener" css

No frameworks used, just html, css and JS.
