# Base Apparel coming soon page

Challenge was to build out the coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Design was given as jpg images for mobile and desktop along with some starter html code. Also, there should be:
* optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
* hover states for all interactive elements on the page
* an error message shown when the form is submitted if the input field is empty or the email address is not formatted correctly
